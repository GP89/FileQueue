FileQueue is a thread-safe queue which is a subclass of Queue.Queue from the
stdlib.

FileQueue will overflow into a compressed file if the number of items
exceeds maxsize, instead of blocking or raising Full like the regular Queue.

The motivation came from wanting to queue a lot of work without consuming
lots of memory.
